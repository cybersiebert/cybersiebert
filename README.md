* 👋 Hi, I’m Matthias Siebert
* 👀 I’m interested in SQL, Python, Tableau, Google Cloud (BigQuery, Looker Studio, …), n8n, and anything that turns data into real insight. If you think “data” is just boring numbers, you’re missing the point.
* 🌱 I’m currently learning Looker Studio and figuring out how much substance there really is behind all the marketing. If someone tells you it’s “super easy,” they either haven’t actually used it or they’re kidding themselves.
* 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that deliver real results—not just pretty dashboards, but solutions that actually make a difference. If you’re just here to stack buzzwords, count me out.
* 📫 How to reach me: Start with LinkedIn, or find me wherever there’s a data mess to sort out. If you have something worth saying, you’ll get a reply.
* 😄 Pronouns: He/him – classic, nothing fancy.
* ⚡ Fun fact: If you’re still afraid of “AI and fancy tools,” you’ll be replaced by an algorithm before you know it. I’d rather get my hands dirty and see what works—then call out the hype when it’s just smoke and mirrors.
